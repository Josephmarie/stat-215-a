This file details your lab2 grade.
Penalties for tardiness and other inconsistencies will be applied separately.
The highest possible score on the lab is 68 points.
Pay attention to your total score relative to other students, rather than your absolute score out of 68.
Each numerical score lists the mean, median, and maximum score among all students in the class.
If you would like a short summary with things to improve,
try to plug this file into chatgpt or something and ask it to tell you what to improve in the future.
It should do an ok job, though it might occasionally contradict my instructions....

I recommend reading the feedback carefully.
Feel free to come to OH or ask privately (or publicly) on Ed to discuss your grade.

GSI comments:
  Good comments, but no modularity in code (no functions or separate files or
  anything) 
PR0:
  The code was well commented and it was pretty easy to follow the train of
  thought. There were a lot of print statements and vignettes with little code:
  maybe it makes sense to group the code better in more coherent ways that would
  make it easier to follow.

GSI comments:
  run.sh doesn't do anything. question_data.Rdata does not exist (it should
  refer to .Rdata). Missing matplotlib import 
PR0:
  Everything was done on a Jupyter notebook which does seem to show easy reprod

Comments:
No explanation of the choice to remove rows with all missing values, or any discussion of data cleaning in the report. 
PR0:
  The cleaning of the data was not described in great detail. In fact, no
  mention of city or state inconsistencies were mentioned. 
======================================EDA=======================================
Relevance of EDA figures (0-2):
0 (mean: 1.7, median: 2.0, max: 2.0)

0 (mean: 1.8, median: 2.0, max: 3.0)
Written comparison (0-2):
1 (mean: 1.6, median: 2.0, max: 2.0)
GSI comments:
  I don't see any evidence of what you write. 
PR0a (discuss it; what might you do differently?):
  There is no discussion on two survey questions in detail. Questions are just
  reported in passing with no in depth visualisation. 
PR0b (like about figures):
  The geographical map showed the origin of points. 
PR0c (how to improve figures):
  A map that was focused on the US would have been more useful. 
Do the answers to the two questions define any distinct geographical groups? (qualitative) (0-1):
0 (mean: 0.9, median: 1.0, max: 1.0)
Does a response to one question help predict the other? (quantitative) (0-1):
0 (mean: 0.4, median: 0.0, max: 1.0)
Try to analyze the categorical data for more than 2 questions (0-1):

=======================BINARY ENCODING AND PREPROCESSING========================
Transform categorical data to binary (0-1):
0 (mean: 0.9, median: 1.0, max: 1.0)
Discuss why binary is necessary (0-1):
0 (mean: 0.2, median: 0.0, max: 1.0)

0 (mean: 0.6, median: 1.0, max: 1.0)
Justify choice of k or k-1:
0 (mean: 0.2, median: 0.0, max: 1.0)
GSI comments:
  Only transformed a couple questions to binary. Discussion of centering and
  scaling is not relevant to binary features. 
==============================DIMENSION REDUCTION===============================
Relevance of figs (0-2), deduct 1 if no location info shown:
1 (mean: 1.7, median: 2.0, max: 2.0)
Quality of figs (0-3):

More than 1 technique used e.g. PCA and non-PCA (0-1):
0 (mean: 0.7, median: 1.0, max: 1.0)
GSI comments:
  Writing sounds like chatgpt. The figure doesn't relate to geography and is a
  weird shape, also uses default plotly settings. Incorrect conclusion about PC1
  and PC2 capturing most of the variance. Discussion mentions clusters but very
  little clustering is apparent in the figure. 
PR0a (discuss it; what might you do differently?):
  PCA makes sense as a reduction technique. Centering and scaling were briefly
  discussed and I think the arguments make choice 
PR0b (like about figures):
  There was a clear spatial representation of PC1 and PC2 
PR0c (how to improve figures):
  The elongated figure made it less appealing to look at for the clustering. 
===================================CLUSTERING===================================
Relevance of figs (0-2), deduct 1 if no location info shown:
1 (mean: 1.7, median: 2.0, max: 2.0)

Detail of writing (0-2):
0 (mean: 1.6, median: 2.0, max: 2.0)
GSI comments:
  Inappropriate use of continuous color scheme for categorical cluster labels.
  No geographic information shown. Discussion incorrectly interprets the figure
  (are the clusters results really so distinct?). Good work explaining that the
  choice of 3 clusters is arbitrary. 
PR0a:
  K means makes sense as a choice. The number of clusters is self-proclaimed
  arbitrary and does not seem to really capture clean clusters 
PR0b:
  The plot visualises the groupings 
PR0c:
  Choice of labels was misleading with a range instead of a category.

ChatGPT-assigned score based on peer reviews  (not part of grade, just in case you are curious):
2 (mean: 2.8, median: 3.0, max: 4.0)
GSI comments:
  Sounds like chatgpt. Very little flow. Many statements unsupported by
  presented results or just don't make sense. e.g. why do you say "I will
  examine the relationship between the selected questions using contingency
  tables and statistical tests to determine whether one response can predict the
  other" when that is not done in the report? Why are the "three key realms of
  data science" you give so different from the ones given in the instructions?
  Why do you say "The analysis revealed potential relationships between
  different lexical choices, suggesting that certain terms may be used in
  conjunction with others" when you do no analysis of multiple questions
  together? There is a reason we don't let students use chatgpt to write for
  them. 
PR0a:
  Grammar was okay. In terms of readability there were some capitalizations in
  the sentences and different bullet points structures which make it a little
  hard to follow at times. Clearly having headers and continuous paragraphs with
  more sparse use of bullet points and lists would make sense to me. 
PR0b:
  The author employs a very collaborative voice making it feel like an
  interesting exploration journey. However, again the bullet points, lists and
  prompts that are left in the report make it seem a little less like a
  narrative and more a checklist completion.
