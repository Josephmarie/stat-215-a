This file details your lab3 grade.
Penalties for tardiness and other inconsistencies will be applied separately.
The highest possible score on the lab is 57 points.
Pay attention to your total score relative to other students, rather than your absolute score out of 57.
Each numerical score lists the mean, median, and maximum score among all students in the class.

Part of the grade is based on benchmarking your similarity function. Specifically, it is the average
of two scores based on the magnitude of your runtime for 5k and 29k samples. If your similarity function
gave a correct output, I have included additional statistics like your function's rank in the class among
those who were correct.

I recommend reading my feedback carefully.
Feel free to come to ask privately (or publicly) on Ed to discuss your grade.

At the end of this file I have included more detailed feedback on your code generated by an LLM. Even if your
code is good, the feedback is very critical because that is how I designed the prompt. It should
at least give you some useful things to think about when you code in the future! Some of the suggestions
may be silly or not applicable so please read with a grain of salt :)

  Very few docstrings. Comments very lacking in some places, e.g. in
  compute_cpu_similarity() and MemoryEfficientSimilarityComputer(). That
  function and class are also repeated between the local and SCF notebooks,
  making the code not very modular. I get the impression that this code was
  written entirely by ChatGPT with very little input from you.

comments:
  Your similarity function does not do the right thing. It is supposed to take
  in two labelings from clustering, and return a single number. Yours takes in
  the whole dataset, clusters it, computes distances from each point to each
  cluster center, then returns a matrix of similarities between all datapoints
  using those distances. This is clearly not what the instructions said.

  Discussion of Jaccard similarity misses the point; the "data" for the

=============================AUTOMATED CODE REVIEW==============================

Below is a code review generated by gpt-4o-mini.
First is the prompt, then the code review.
----------------------------------BEGIN PROMPT----------------------------------
This is a college student's code for an applied statistics assignment. Please review it carefully. Be very critical. These are the criteria you should consider:
- excellent Python style for variables, functions, classes, etc.
- excellent use of whitespace
- high level of modularity
- excellent documentation throughout the code (comments and docstrings)
- comments should include both micro-level comments explaining nontrivial pieces of code and macro-level comments explaining the overall structure and purpose
- good choice of variable names
- low redundancy
- no hardcoded absolute paths (hardcoded relative paths are okay)
- high performance and efficiency
- other general style things
Provide a some detailed, concrete feedback, giving examples from the code and avoiding flowery language. Do not start with a general positive comment.

-----------------------------------END PROMPT-----------------------------------
-----------------------------BEGIN LLM CODE REVIEW------------------------------

The provided code for the applied statistics assignment has several areas that require improvement. Below is a detailed critique based on the specified criteria:

### 1. Python Style
- **Variable Naming**: While most variable names are descriptive, some could be improved for clarity. For example, `B` in `MemoryEfficientSimilarityComputer` could be renamed to `num_batches` to clarify its purpose.
- **Function Naming**: Function names should be in `snake_case` as per PEP 8 guidelines. For instance, `compute_similarity_from_csv` is correctly named, but `get_binary_csv_iterator` could be more descriptive, such as `create_binary_csv_iterator`.

### 2. Whitespace
- **Whitespace Usage**: The code generally uses whitespace well, but there are instances where additional blank lines could improve readability. For example, separating function definitions with two blank lines is recommended.
- **Inconsistent Spacing**: In some places, there is inconsistent spacing around operators. For example, in `optimal_chunk_size = int(min(self.max_chunk_size, (available_memory * 0.5) / memory_per_sample))`, there should be spaces around the `=` operator for consistency.

### 3. Modularity
- **Modularity**: The code is fairly modular, but some functions could be further broken down. For instance, the `compute_similarity_matrix` function is quite long and could benefit from breaking it into smaller helper functions, such as one for loading data and another for processing similarities.

### 4. Documentation
- **Docstrings**: While some functions have docstrings, they could be more comprehensive. For example, the `compute_similarity_from_csv` function should include descriptions of the parameters and return values.
- **Macro-level Comments**: The overall structure of the code could benefit from a high-level comment at the beginning of each major section (e.g., data loading, processing, and analysis) to explain the purpose of that section.

### 5. Comments
- **Micro-level Comments**: While there are some comments explaining nontrivial pieces of code, they could be more consistent. For example, the comment `# Let's compute similarities with minimal memory usage` could be more descriptive about the algorithm being implemented.
- **Redundant Comments**: Some comments are redundant, such as `# Let's clear memory`, which could be omitted as the code itself is self-explanatory.

### 6. Redundancy
- **Redundant Imports**: The code imports several libraries multiple times (e.g., `numpy`, `pandas`). These should be imported once at the beginning of the script.
- **Repeated Code**: The logic for loading CSV data is repeated in multiple functions. This could be encapsulated in a single function to reduce redundancy.

### 7. Hardcoded Paths
- **Absolute Paths**: The code contains hardcoded absolute paths (e.g., `"/Users/user/Desktop/stat-215-a/lab3/data/lingBinary.Rdata"`). These should be replaced with relative paths or parameterized to improve portability.

### 8. Performance and Efficiency
- **Memory Management**: The use of `gc.collect()` is good, but it should be used judiciously. Frequent calls can lead to performance overhead. Consider profiling memory usage to determine optimal points for garbage collection.
- **Batch Processing**: The batch processing logic is well-implemented, but the choice of batch size could be made more dynamic based on the dataset size.

### 9. General Style
- **Consistent Use of Print Statements**: The print statements for performance metrics are clear, but consider using logging instead of print for better control over output verbosity.
- **Error Handling**: The error handling in the `try-except` block is good, but it could be improved by providing more specific error messages or handling different exceptions separately.

### 10. Additional Suggestions
- **Testing**: Consider adding unit tests for critical functions to ensure correctness and facilitate future changes.
- **Type Annotations**: Adding type annotations to function parameters and return types can improve code readability and help with static type checking.

### Conclusion
Overall, the code demonstrates a solid understanding of the task at hand, but it requires improvements in style, documentation, modularity, and efficiency. By addressing these issues, the code will be more maintainable, readable, and efficient.
